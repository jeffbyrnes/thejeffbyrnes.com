Quick Start
===========

ThinkUp includes a three-step, web-based installer. To use it:

1. Download the latest distribution of `ThinkUp <http://thinkupapp.com>`_.
2. Extract the zip file into a web-accessible folder.
3. Visit that URL in your browser and proceed through the installation process.

Once ThinkUp is installed, log in and click on Settings to activate the plugins of your choice. Click on
each one to configure any necessary API keys or other settings.

To begin capturing your data, log into ThinkUp, and click the "Update now" link in the top left corner to
run the ThinkUp crawler and begin capturing your posts and replies.
