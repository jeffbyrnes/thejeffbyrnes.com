How to Report a Bug or Make a Feature Request
=============================================

ThinkUp is an open source project mostly built by volunteers, who troubleshoot and discuss features
in public community spaces. If you've found a ThinkUp bug or have an idea for a new feature, here's what you can do
to get help or feedback most efficiently.

Step 1: Search
--------------

To avoid duplicate work, search `ThinkUp's documentation <http://thinkupapp.com/docs/>`_, 
`mailing list archive <https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/issues>`_ and
`issue tracker <https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/issues>`_ to make sure your
problem or idea hasn't already been documented, discussed or reported. If it has, follow up on the existing mailing
list thread thread or issue tracker comment thread to discuss further.

If your problem or idea hasn't been addressed before, continue to Step 2.

Step 2: Don't File An Issue
---------------------------

`ThinkUp's issue tracker <https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/issues>`_ is public, but you shouldn't file a new
issue unless the problem or feature request has been
confirmed by the ThinkUp community. If you file a new issue without discussing it with the community, no one but Gina
will receive the new issue notification. If she cannot reproduce the bug or isn't sold on the feature pitch, she
will close the issue. There's a better chance someone in the community at large will be able to reproduce your problem
or get excited about your feature.

Instead of filing a new issue, discuss the problem/idea with the community first to confirm it is indeed a new issue
and not a known bug, a rejected feature idea or an environmental problem versus an application code bug.

Step 3: Contact the Community
-----------------------------

Send an email to the `ThinkUp mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/thinkupapp>`_ describing your problem or
feature idea. Be specific.

For bug reports, describe step by step exactly what you did and what went wrong, including application messaging word
for word, as well as what version of ThinkUp you are running and what operating system and version of PHP and MySQL
you are running.

For feature ideas, describe exactly how you think the new functionality should work, and include wireframes and 
screenshots. Sell your idea to the community by clearly explaining its benefits and use cases, and how you plan to 
help make the feature. We only build features which align with :doc:`ThinkUp's purpose </intro>`.

Thanks for helping us make ThinkUp a great application, and for respecting the community's time and public spaces.
