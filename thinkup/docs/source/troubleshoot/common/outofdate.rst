==========================================

ThinkUp won't update itself unless you have a scheduled task running on the server or are requesting the crawler's RSS
feed. Instructions for setting up both appear on the crawler update page. Click on the "Update now" link in ThinkUp's
status bar and see the instructions at the bottom of the page.
