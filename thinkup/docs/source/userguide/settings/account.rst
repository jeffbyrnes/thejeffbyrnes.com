Account
=======

In the account area of ThinkUp's settings, you can change your ThinkUp account password and API key.

Change Your Password
--------------------

To change your ThinkUp user password, enter your current password, and your new password (once more to confirm). Then
click on the "Change password" button.

Remember, your ThinkUp password must be at least 5 characters long.

Reset Your API Key
------------------

External applications use your ThinkUp API key for authentication via a special, secret URL which contains the key. 

For example, RSS news readers can update your ThinkUp data using a special URL which contains this key. If the URL
does not contain the right key, ThinkUp will not update.

If you've accidentally published or shared a URL which contains your ThinkUp API key, change it and update any places
you've used the URL. For example, once you've reset your API key, you'll have to update your RSS feed subscription 
URL to the new key.

To change your API key, click on the "Reset Your API Key" button. Then, visit the 
:doc:`Update Now page </userguide/datacapture>` to copy and paste the updated feed URL into your newsreader.
