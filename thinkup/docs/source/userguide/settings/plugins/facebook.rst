Facebook
========

ThinkUp's Facebook plugin collects status updates for Facebook users and the Facebook pages those users like. The 
Facebook plugin is not as robust as the Twitter plugin, but we plan to get it up to speed in the coming months.

Configure the Facebook Plugin (Admin only)
------------------------------------------

To use the Facebook plugin, you'l need to `create a Facebook application on facebook.com 
<http://developers.facebook.com/setup/>`_. Set the Web Site > Site URL  as recommended, and the Facebook-provided API
Key, Application Secret and Application ID in the Facebook plugin's settings page in ThinkUp.

Add a Facebook user profile to ThinkUp
--------------------------------------

Once the Facebook plugin has been configured, to add a Facebook user to ThinkUp, click on the "Connect with Facebook"
button to add your user account.

Add a Facebook page to ThinkUp
------------------------------

ThinkUp's Facebook plugin works with Facebook pages, but it can only connect with regular Facebook user accounts.
To add a Facebook page, connect a regular Facebook user account to ThinkUp. Make sure that user "likes" the page, and
then add it to ThinkUp from the Likes dropdown in ThinkUp.
