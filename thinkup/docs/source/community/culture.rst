We Do Meaningful Work
---------------------

ThinkUp development is funded and led by `Expert Labs <http://expertlabs.org>`_, a non-profit startup that helps
government be more effective by tapping into the power of social networks.

Fundamentally, we believe that the power of conversations by ordinary citizens online can change the world. That's why
we build ThinkUp.
